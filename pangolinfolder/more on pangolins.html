<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The pangolin is a mammal that looks unusual and is covered with scales instead of fur. The scales are made of keratin, the same protein found in hair and nails. Threatened pangolins roll into a ball and are so protected by the scales that most large predators cannot bite into them.</p>

<h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>

<p>The Chinese, Sunda, Indian, and Philippine pangolins live in Asia, although no wild pangolins have been seen in China for several years. The ground, giant, black-bellied, and white-bellied pangolins live in Africa.</p>

<h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>

<p>Pangolins eat ants and termites. These nocturnal insectivores consume 4.9 to 7.1 ounces of insects daily. They don't have teeth, so they swallow small stones to help digest prey. While hunting with their sense of smell, pangolins seal their nose and ears and close their eyes when feeding.</p>

<h2>Reproduction and Offspring</h2>

<p>Except for mating, pangolins are solitary creatures. Males mark territory with scent from anal glands, urine, and feces. In the summer or fall, females follow the scent to find a mate. After mating, the female searches for or digs a burrow to give birth and raise her young.</p>
